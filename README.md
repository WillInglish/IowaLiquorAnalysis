# Personal Project- **Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis**

## Objective
Find insights using machine learning and clustering procedures of selected open-source data. 

## Data
The data was derived from an open-source site. Here is the [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielramos87/iowa-sales-liquor-jan-2021jan-2022) for the dataset.
Here is the [Link](https://gist.github.com/mcwhittemore/96aaa132af24d3114643?short_path=2d782d3) for the Json file. 

The only note is that I had to format the Json file to only have the counties names, which ended with "County, IA".
